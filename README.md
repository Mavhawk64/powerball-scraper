# powerball-scraper
This is a web scraper that I created using NodeJS that grabs numbers off of the Powerball website.

I don't know why, but it won't let me upload the node_modules. Here is a link to a google drive folder that contains the .zip folder: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ngtgSgVWSn9qmKkUXimjS2-TnPCE8ABZ/view?usp=sharing

Run
```node scrape.js```
